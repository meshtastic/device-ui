## :wave: Introduction

### Meshtastic device-ui library for TFT and OLED screens

This C++ library is intended to support the following scenarios with enhanced screen UI:

- Integrated with meshtastic firmware for LoRa devices with TFT display (or potentially also OLED +PSRAM)
- Stand-alone TFT+MCU devices such as WT32-SC01, CYD or T-HMI connected with meshtastic LoRa devices
- Linux based devices with LoRa shield, e.g Raspberry Pi / Milk-V Duo/Mars with TFT display (hat or diy)
- Native Linux X11 application with SimRadio e.g. for tests, GUI simulation & debugging (MQTT only application)
